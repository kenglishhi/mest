        <p>One drawback we see immediatly is getting equal heights for
       the left navigation div and right content div. The work around I
       use for this is: whichever is likely to be the shortest (in
       height) div, probably the left navigation div, set the background
       of the #body div the same as this, also the border separating the
     two divs - that should be on the right content div.</p>
     <p>Another problem discovered recently was that when you use the
       float property it can cause the floated divs to "jump out" of
       their container block. The workaround I found for this was simply
     to specify a height for the container div.</p>
